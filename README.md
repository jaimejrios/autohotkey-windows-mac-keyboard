Breezily for Windows 10
==============================================

This [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) configuration file makes navigating Windows 10 a breeze. Program is loosely based off macOS cursor navigation controls (when replacing the 'CapsLock' key with 'Ctrl').

Breezily has been tested with an English (United States) keyboard layout, but should work under different layouts as well.

1) Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
