Breezily for Windows 10
---

This [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) app helps make Windows a breeze to navigate. It's loosely based off macOS cursor navigation controls (when replacing the `Caps Lock` key with `Ctrl`).

Breezily has been tested with an English (US) keyboard layout, but should work under different layouts too. [SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys) is required to use Breezily.

Good Stuff To Know:
- **What is AutoHotkey?** - An automation scription language for Windows.
- **What are Hotkeys?** - Automation commands programmed with [AutoHotkey](http://autohotkey.com/).
- **What is Hotclicking?** - Using a hotkey command to mouse click.
- **What is a Hotcursor** - A hotkey command to move the mouse pointer/cursor.

Installing Breezily

1) Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2) Download the latest Breezily [release](https://github.com/jairio3/breezily/releases) of Breezily.
3) Add your downloaded `Breezily.exe` file to the `/Local Disk (C:)/Program Files/AutoHotkey/` directory.

Setting Up Breezily
---

Let's set up Breezily to start at log on using the Task Scheduler app.

1) Press the `Windows` and `R` keys together, and enter `taskschd.msc` on the Run menu.
2) Next, click the `Create Task` option on the right side of the Task Scheduler app (under the `Actions` menu).
3) Enter in a name for your task (i.e. `Run Breezily`).
4) Select the option to `Run only when user is logged on`.
5) Check the box to `Run with highest privileges` (this enables Breezily commands to run inside admin-elevated apps like Git Bash).
6) Click on the `Configure For` drop-down menu and select `Windows 10`.
7) Next, click on the `Triggers` tab (at the top of the `Create Task` menu), then click `New...`.
8) Afterwards, click the `Begin the task:` drop-down menu and select `At log on`, then click `OK`.
9) Click the `Actions` tab (near the top 
of the `Create Task` menu), then click `New`.
10) Then click the `Action:` drop-down menu and select `Start a program`.
11) Now click `Browse...` and select the `Breezily.exe` file at its current file location, then click `OK`.
12) After that, click the `Conditions` tab, and uncheck both options under the `Power` category.
13) Next, click the `Settings` tab, and uncheck the `Stop the task if it runs longer than:` option, then click `OK`.

Whew! We're almost done. Let's move onto the final step with installing SharpKeys and remapping some keys so that Breezily will be ready to go!

1) Download and install [SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys).
2) Press the `Windows` key to search for and open the SharpKeys program.
3) After SharpKeys is open, click `Add` to remap the `Caps Lock` key to `F16`, then click `OK`
4) Next, click `Add` once to remap the `Right Alt` key to `F17`, then click `OK`.
5) After that, click on `Write to Registry`.
6) Lastily, restart your PC so that the SharpKey changes can be added.

Now to make sure Breezily runs smoothly when snapping windows, follow these two quick steps...
1) Press the `Windows` key and type `Snap Settings`, then press `Enter`.
2) Leave the `Snap Windows` option checked, and uncheck all other options.
3) You're all done! Enjoy Breezily :)
